 <h2>how to make french friest</h2>
 <p>A thin strip of potato, usually cut 3 to 4 inches in length and about 1/4 to 3/8 inches square that are deep fried until they are golden brown and crisp textured on the outside while remaining white and soft on the inside. French fries are not French in origin. They are referred to as French because of the way they are cut. Very thin strips may be referred to as shoestring potatoes and thicker strips are called steak fries. In Britain, french fries are referred to as chips.</p>
